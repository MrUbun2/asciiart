# asciiart
***please use python 3!*** (tested on 3.11)<br/>
very simple ascii art generator made in python

## usage
install numpy and PIL for python

when it asks you for the font, you have to put in a truetype (.ttf) font that matches your terminal/command line.
this will be used for calculating brightness of each character.

when it asks you for an image, you can put in any format that PIL supports (.jpg, .png, .bmp, etc)

## other stuff
the number you put in for height will not nesecarilly be the number of lines the output is (see code for explanation)
